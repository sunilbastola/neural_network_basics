    "#### Neural Networks Introduction\n",
    "This is a basic neural network practice with Pytorch. Neural Networks or the Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) are the building blocks of the modern deep learning, and it was inspired by the biological neuron however it has no technical relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks learn the important features by themselves automatically, unlike traditional machine learning where we have to provide features for the model. This process is done by a process called backpropagation, where the model learns through comparing the result with the actual output and gradually changes the weights, based on the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, torch, nn and Datasets, dataloader and transforms are applied to understand the \n",
    "concepts of neural networks."
